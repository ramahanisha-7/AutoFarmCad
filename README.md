# AutoFarmCad
The main aim of developing this Solar based Robot for garden grass cutting and watering Plants IoT project is to provide an easy way of cutting grass and watering methods to the farmers without much manual interaction.

This is the solar powered grass cutting robot and water Sprinkler which includes Arduino Board, Bluetooth, Two channel Relay module, and moto drivers and Solar panel, Cutter Blade.

One of the other purpose of this project is to be more friendly to environment as well as user. W e have developed an app which will help the user to control the bot from a distance.
